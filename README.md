================

AI #15 is due on Tuesday, 6 May. Write a genetic algorithm (GA) that learns all ones for a 32 bit chromosome. Make your program able to work for any size input string. It should be able to randomly generate the initial population. Do the standard selection, crossover, and mutation as discussed in class. At each x generations display the best individual along with its fitness and the average fitness of the population.
